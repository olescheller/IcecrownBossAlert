# IcecrowBossAlert

Source code of the WoW interface addon IcecrowBossAlert.

## Description

Minimalstic addon that announces (by audio) the spawn of event bosses in Icecrown during the pre-patch event of Shadowlands.

There are two different audio alerts. First, on any boss spawn, an audio alert "Boss spawned" is played. Then, after 120 seconds the boss becomes attackable, another audio alert "Boss attackable" is played.

Recommended settings for AFK-farming the bosses:
- Install this addon
- Enable WoW sound in background
- Disable all sounds, e.g. `crtl + s`

This addon plays its audio even if all other sounds are muted.
