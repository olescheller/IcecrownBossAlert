# IcecrowBossAlert

Source code of the WoW interface addon IcecrowBossAlert.

## Description

Minimalstic addon that announces (by audio) the spawn of event bosses in Icecrown during the pre-patch event of Shadowlands.

There are two different audio alerts. First, on any boss spawn an audio alert "Boss spawned" is played. Then, after 120 seconds the boss becomes attackable, another audio alert "Boss attackable" is played.

Recommended settings for semi-afk farming the bosses:
- Install this addon
- Enable WoW sound in background (`System -> Sound -> Playback -> Sound in Background`)
- Disable all sounds, e.g. `crtl + s`

This addon plays its audio even if all other in-game sounds are muted. Through using the configuration above, you can alt-tab out of WoW, enjoy silence and still get alerted.
